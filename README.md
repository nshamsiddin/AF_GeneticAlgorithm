This is the implementation of Genetic Algorithm

Patterns implemented:
- Abstract Factory
  - dsaf
    The pattern provides an interface that is used to create a family of products without specificly telling their classes
    In the project a family of products are different types of Populations (X and Z, where X contains individuals with genes endoded with binary code, Z is individual creatures whith genes encoded by bases - a, t, g, c).
    PopulationGenerator is a factory interface for product creation, whereas Crossover provides Factory methods.
- Strategy
  - 
- Singleton
